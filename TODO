TODO
====

* Bundle the webapp as a proper Perl module and
  release it on cpan as App::Openlog

* event-sources and event-targets don't have their
  own db table, and are/have to be harcoded into
  the config.yml file

* Past polled data (to know which entries from
  event-sources are new and which ones are old) is
  written into a JSON file, polls.json, which parses
  quite fast but is no satisfying substitute for a
  proper db table or similar

* Mature db format and probably move away from the
  current "pseudo-doc store in a SQL db" to a proper
  indexed NoSQL db to handle our JSON blobs.

* write a GUI interface to add/edit/delete event-
  sources and event-targets

* right now, event-source polling and event-target
  push is not a real background process but has to
  be triggered manually

* Greasemonkey Plug-In is incomplete

* Nicer event logging, with more assistance

* Nicer interface, probably with a graphical timeline
  and event-bubbles

* Make the webapp skinnable through html+css themes
